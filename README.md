# Website Crawler with Screenshot Capture

This Python script is a powerful tool that automatically crawls a website, visiting every internal link and capturing a screenshot of each page. It's like having a personal Wayback Machine, enabling you to visually document the entire structure of a website. This script is especially useful for developers, SEO specialists, and anyone interested in web automation and site analysis.

## Features

- **Automated Web Crawling**: The script visits all internal links on a specified website.
- **Screenshot Capture**: A screenshot of each visited page is saved in a structured folder.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: The script scrolls through each page to load dynamic content.
- **Robust Error Handling**: It gracefully handles issues like stale elements and missing elements, ensuring the crawl continues uninterrupted.
- **Structured Output**: Screenshots are saved with filenames derived from the URLs, making it easy to identify and navigate through them.
